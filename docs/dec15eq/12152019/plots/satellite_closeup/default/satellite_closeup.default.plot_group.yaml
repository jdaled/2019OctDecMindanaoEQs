title: InSAR Displacements (Closeup)
description: '

  Maps showing subsampled surface displacements as observed, modelled and the

  residual (observed minus modelled).


  The displacement values predicted by the orbit-ambiguity ramps are added to the

  modelled displacements (middle panels). The color shows the LOS displacement

  values associated with, and the extent of, every quadtree box. The light grey

  dots show the focal point of pixels combined in the quadtree box. This point

  corresponds to the position of the modelled data point.


  The large dark grey dot shows the reference source position. The grey filled

  box shows the surface projection of the modelled source, with the thick-lined

  edge marking the upper fault edge. Map is focused around the fault''s extent.
